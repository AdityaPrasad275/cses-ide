# Phase 2: Frontend Editor UI

This document details the work completed in Phase 2, focusing on building the core user interface for the code editor.

---

## Summary of Changes

The primary goal of this phase was to replace the basic `textarea` with a professional code editor and establish the main application layout.

### 1. Monaco Editor Integration

- **Installed Monaco Editor:** The `@monaco-editor/react` package was added to the `client` project to provide a feature-rich editing experience, including syntax highlighting and theming.
- **Replaced `textarea`:** In `client/src/App.tsx`, the simple `textarea` was replaced with the `<Editor />` component from the new package.

### 2. UI Layout and Components

- **Split-Screen Layout:** A two-column layout was created using Flexbox in `client/src/App.css`.
  - The left column (`.problem-container`) is a placeholder for the CSES problem description.
  - The right column (`.editor-container`) holds the code editor and related UI elements.

- **Buttons:** "Run" and "Submit" buttons were added below the editor.
  - The "Run" button is currently mocked to display "Hello, World!".
  - The "Submit" button retains the original functionality of sending the code to the backend.

- **Input/Output Areas:** Two `textarea` elements were added below the buttons for handling custom input and displaying program output.
  - The "Input" area is user-editable.
  - The "Output" area is read-only and will display the results from running or submitting the code.

### 3. Styling

- **`App.css` Overhaul:** The stylesheet was completely updated to support the new layout.
- **Dark Theme:** A dark, IDE-like theme was established, with specific styles for the editor container, buttons, and I/O text areas to ensure a consistent look and feel.
