# Phase 4 Frontend: Fairly Completed UI Documentation

This document outlines the significant frontend changes and UI refactorings implemented during Phase 4, bringing the CSES IDE to a fairly completed state for problem viewing and code interaction.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Routing and Page Structure
- **`react-router-dom` Integration:** The application now uses `react-router-dom` for client-side routing, enabling navigation between different views.
- **Home Page (`/`):** A new component, `ProblemListPage.tsx`, serves as the home page, displaying a list of available problems.
- **Problem View Page (`/problems/:problemId`):** The `ProblemView.tsx` component is dedicated to displaying individual problems, including their description, a code editor, and an integrated console.

### 2. Problem View UI Refinements (`ProblemView.tsx`)

#### Layout
- **Side-by-Side Panes:** The problem description and code editor are displayed in a side-by-side layout, optimizing screen real estate for coding tasks.
- **Integrated Console Drawer:** A console drawer is integrated at the bottom, providing areas for input and output.

#### Button Placement and Behavior
- **"Run" and "Submit" Buttons:** These buttons have been moved from the console drawer to a dedicated toolbar at the top of the code editor pane.
- **Console Drawer Visibility:** The console drawer is now always visible, eliminating the need for a toggle button.
- **"Home" Button:** A "Home" button is placed in the top-right corner of the problem description container, allowing easy navigation back to the problem list.

#### Scrolling and Sizing
- **Problem Description Scrolling:** The problem description area (`.problem-container`) is independently scrollable to accommodate lengthy problem statements.
- **Code Editor Scrolling:** The Monaco Editor (`.editor-container`) handles its own scrolling for code.
- **Input/Output Textareas:** The input and output textareas within the console drawer are designed to occupy the available space and are independently scrollable for their content.

## Modified and Created Files

### Client-side (`client/`)

- **`client/src/App.tsx`**: Refactored to implement routing logic, directing to `ProblemListPage` or `ProblemView` based on the URL.
- **`client/src/main.tsx`**: Wrapped the main `App` component with `BrowserRouter` to enable routing.
- **`client/src/pages/ProblemListPage.tsx` (New)**: Component responsible for fetching and displaying the list of problems.
- **`client/src/pages/ProblemView.tsx`**: Significant refactoring to incorporate the new UI layout, button placements, and console drawer behavior.
- **`client/src/App.css`**: Extensively modified to support the new layout, including styles for:
    - `.ide-layout`, `.main-panes`, `.problem-container`, `.editor-container`
    - `.problem-list`, `.problem-list-item`
    - `.problem-header`, `.home-button`
    - `.editor-toolbar` (newly added for "Run"/"Submit" buttons)
    - `.console-drawer` (adjusted for always-visible state and fixed height)
    - `.io-container`, `.input-area`, `.output-area`, and `textarea` elements (for proper sizing and scrolling within the console).
- **`client/package.json`**: Updated to include `react-router-dom`.
- **`client/tsconfig.app.json`**: Minor adjustments for type checking.
- **`client/src/App.test.tsx`**: Updated to reflect new routing tests.

## Remaining UI Considerations (Future Work)

While the UI is "fairly completed," there are known areas for potential improvement:
- Further refinement of responsive design for various screen sizes.
- Enhanced visual feedback for "Run" and "Submit" actions.
- More robust error handling and display within the UI.
- General aesthetic polish and adherence to a consistent design system.
