# UI Refactor: LeetCode-Style Layout

This document outlines the successful refactoring of the frontend UI into a modern, single-page application layout with a collapsible console, similar to platforms like LeetCode.

## 1. Goal

The primary objective was to improve the user experience by:
-   [x] Creating a fixed, full-height layout where the Problem and Editor panes are always visible.
-   [x] Enabling independent scrolling for the Problem and Editor panes.
-   [x] Moving the Input/Output areas and Run/Submit buttons into a collapsible "console" drawer to maximize editor space.

## 2. Implementation Summary

The refactor was executed according to the original plan, involving significant changes to state, JSX structure, and CSS architecture.

-   **State Management:** A new state variable, `isConsoleOpen`, was added to `App.tsx` to manage the drawer's visibility.
-   **JSX Restructuring:** The component's render method was reorganized to separate the main content panes (Problem & Editor) from the new `console-drawer`.
-   **CSS Overhaul:** The stylesheet was completely rewritten to use a `vh`-based, flexbox layout, enabling the fixed panes and animated drawer.

## 3. Bug Fix: Console Content Visibility

### The Problem
After the initial implementation, a UI bug was discovered: the content of the console (the I/O panes and buttons) remained visible even when the drawer was collapsed. The drawer's height would shrink, but the content would overflow instead of disappearing, defeating the purpose of the feature.

### The Solution
The bug was traced to two small issues and was resolved with the following fixes:

1.  **Default State:** The `isConsoleOpen` state in `App.tsx` was initialized to `false` instead of `true`. This ensures the console starts in the collapsed state, providing a cleaner initial view for the user.
    ```tsx
    // Before
    const [isConsoleOpen, setIsConsoleOpen] = useState(true);
    // After
    const [isConsoleOpen, setIsConsoleOpen] = useState(false);
    ```

2.  **CSS Logic:** The CSS was corrected to explicitly hide the `.console-content` when the `.console-drawer` does not have the `.open` class. This ensures the content is properly removed from the layout when collapsed, not just hidden behind a smaller container.
    ```css
    .console-drawer:not(.open) .console-content {
      display: none; /* This was the key fix */
    }
    ```

## 4. Final Outcome

The UI now functions as intended. The application has a professional, modern layout with independently scrolling panes and a smooth, collapsible console drawer, marking a significant improvement in usability and aesthetics.
