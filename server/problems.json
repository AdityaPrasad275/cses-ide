    "description": "Consider an algorithm that takes as input a positive integer n. If n is even, the algorithm divides it by two, and if n is odd, the algorithm multiplies it by three and adds one. The algorithm repeats this, until n is one. For example, the sequence for n=3 is 3 -> 10 -> 5 -> 16 -> 8 -> 4 -> 2 -> 1. Your task is to simulate the execution of the algorithm for a given value of n.",
